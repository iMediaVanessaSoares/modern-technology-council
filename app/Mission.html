Every business needs a technologist...

The mission of the Modern Technology (MT) Council is to bring Modern Technology to the forefront of local education, workforce, and business. Our solution is to marry the education system and their students to modern technologists, Sr. Engineers, and projects supplied by the community and Council Members. The result will be the production of top-technologists from Massachusetts that remain in Massachusetts. We will foster even greater growth in our technology economy.  We promote, adhere to and and seek to enforce the same Open Standards, philosophies, and culture that has revolutionized technology in the past decade.
